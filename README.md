The thermomechanical stresses due to the variation in coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) of the base material, material of the chips and the adhesives has a significant impact of the stresses in the product used in high temperature applications. The subject essentially consists of SiC die attached to an Alumina substrate using epoxies attach. Characterization of the heat distribution within the die attach, die and substrate along the thermal resistance of the die attach is essential to predicting the reliability of the packaging structure.  A parametric research has been performed to find the heat flux distribution and thermal shock resistance by simulating it at high temperature and comparing it with analytical calculation. The project also focuses on the processes involved in the packaging of the die and study of the devices and their functions. 
The outcome of the project is to provide guidelines to optimize the design of the package and comparison and getting to hand on work knowledge on the whole process of the packaging. The packaging is done in the VAPD lab of Semi-Conductor laboratory and the simulation of the thermomechanical designing is done on various software like CATIA, ANSYS AIM etc.
